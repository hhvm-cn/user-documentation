The type `void` indicates the absence of a value. It is used to declare that a function does *not* return any value. As such, a void function
can contain one or more `return` statements, provided none of them return a value.  Consider the following example:

As is often the case, a function like `draw_line` causes something to happen but does not need to return a result or success code, so its return
type is `void`. Likewise, for method `move`.

Here's another example, involving a generic stack type:

```
class Stack<T> {
  // ...
  public function push(T $value): void { /* ... */ }
  // ...
}
```

The act of pushing a value on a stack does not require any value to be returned. However, method `push` could fail due to stack overflow; however,
as that is an extreme situation, the method likely would throw an exception that is only handled when the condition occurs rather than returning a
success/failure code that would have to be checked on every call.
