The binary operator `.` creates a string that is the concatenation of the left-hand operand and the right-hand operand, in that order. If
either or both operands have types other than `string`, their values are converted to type `string`. Consider the following example:

As `$p1` designates an object, the expression `$p1 . "\n"` causes the method `__toString` to be called on that object, which returns
the string `"(20,30)"`, the concatenation of the three single-quoted string literals and the two `float`s. That string in turn is
concatenated with the double-quoted string containing a newline, and the resulting string is written to standard output. Here are some
more examples, which all involve conversion to `string`:

```Hack
-10 . \NAN               // string result with value "-10NAN"
\INF . "2e+5"            // string result with value "INF2e+5"
true . null              // string result with value "1"
```
