The documentation here focuses on generally supported installations. However, there are some unsupported installation instructions for other distributions as well. You can find these on the [HHVM GitHub wiki](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/wiki).

If you use [Heroku](http://heroku.com), you can [install HHVM](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/php-support) as one of the default PHP supported engines.

There is also a [Heroku buildpack](https://github.com/hhvm/heroku-buildpack-hhvm), but it has not been updated in a while.
