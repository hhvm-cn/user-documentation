In general, an async operation has the following pattern:
* Call an `async` function
* Get an awaitable back
* `await` the awaitable to get a result

However, sometimes an async function can throw an exception. The good news is that the same exception object that would be thrown in the
non-async version of the code will be returned when we `await` the awaitable.

The use of `from_async` ignores any successful awaitable results and just throw an exception of one of the
awaitable results, if one of the results was an exception.

To get around this, and get the successful results as well, we can use the [utility function](utility-functions.md)
[`HH\Asio\wrap`](/hack/reference/function/HH.Asio.wrap/). It takes an awaitable and returns the expected result or the exception
if one was thrown. The exception it gives back is of the type [`ResultOrExceptionWrapper`](/hack/reference/interface/HH.Asio.ResultOrExceptionWrapper/).

```Hack
namespace HH\Asio {
  interface ResultOrExceptionWrapper<T> {
    public function isSucceeded(): bool;
    public function isFailed(): bool;
    public function getResult(): T;
    public function getException(): \Exception;
  }
}
```

Taking the example above and using the wrapping mechanism, this is what the code looks like:
