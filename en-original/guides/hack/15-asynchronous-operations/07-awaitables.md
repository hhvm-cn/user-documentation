An *awaitable* is the key construct in `async` code. An awaitable is a first-class object that represents a possibly asynchronous
operation that may or may not have completed. We `await` the awaitable until the operation has completed.

## `Awaitable`

Awaitables are represented by the interface called `Awaitable`. While there are several classes that implement `Awaitable`, there is no
need to concern ourselves with their implementation details. `Awaitable` is the only interface we need.

The type returned from an async function is `Awaitable<T>`, where `T` is the final result type (e.g., `int`) of the awaited value.

```Hack
async function foo(): Awaitable<int> { ... }

$x = foo();         // $x will be an Awaitable<int>
$x = await foo();   // $x will be an int
```

All `async` functions must return an `Awaitable<T>`. Calling an `async` function will therefore yield an object implementing the `Awaitable`
interface, and we must `await` or `join` it to obtain an end result from the operation. When we `await`, we are pausing the current task until
the operation associated with the `Awaitable` handle is complete, leaving other tasks free to continue executing. `join` is similar; however it
blocks all other operations from completing until the `Awaitable` has returned.

## Awaiting

In most cases, we will prefer to `await` an `Awaitable`, so that other tasks can execute while our blocking operation completes.  Note however,
that only `async` functions can yield control to other asyncs, so `await` may therefore only be used in an `async` function.  For other locations,
such as a `main` block, we will need to use `join`, as will be shown below.

### Batching Awaitables

Many times, we will `await` on one `Awaitable`, get the result, and move on. For example:

@@ awaitables-examples/single-awaitable.php @@

We will normally see something like `await f();` which combines the retrieval of the awaitable with the waiting and retrieving of the result
of that awaitable. The example above separates it out for illustration purposes.

At other times, we will gather a bunch of awaitables and `await` them all before moving on.

Here we are using one of the library helper-functions in order to batch a bunch of awaitables together to then `await` upon:
* `HH\Lib\Vec\from_async`: vec of awaitables with consecutive integer keys
* `HH\Lib\Dict\from_async`: dict of awaitables with integer or string keys

## Join

Sometimes we want to get a result out of an awaitable when the function we are in is *not* `async`. For this there is `HH\Asio\join`, which
takes an `Awaitable` and blocks until it resolves to a result.

This means that invocations of async functions from the top-level scope cannot be awaited, and must be joined.

@@ awaitables-examples/join.php @@

We should **not** call `join` inside an `async` function. This would defeat the purpose of `async`, as the awaitable and any dependencies will
run to completion synchronously, stopping any other awaitables from running.
