A `return` statement can only occur inside a function, in which case, it causes that function to terminate normally.  The function can
optionally return a single value (but one which could contain other values, as in a tuple, a shape, or an object of some user-defined
type), whose type must be compatible with the function's declared return type.  If the `return` statement contains no value, or there
is no `return` statement (in which case, execution drops into the function's closing brace), no value is returned.  For example:

However, for an async function having a `void` return type, an object of type `Awaitable<void>` is returned.  For an async function,
the value having a non-`void` return type, the return value is wrapped in an object of type `Awaitable<T>` (where `T` is the type of
the return value), which is returned.

Returning from a constructor behaves just like returning from a function having a return type of `void`.

The value returned by a [generator function](../expressions-and-operators/yield.md) must be the literal `null`.  A `return` statement
inside a generator function causes the generator to terminate.

A return statement must not occur in a finally block or in a function declared [`noreturn`](../built-in-types/noreturn.md).
