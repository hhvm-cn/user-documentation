Strictly speaking, the type `mixed` is a [nullable type](../types/nullable-types.md) in that a variable of type `mixed` can contain a value of *any* data
type, including `null`.

Although there are rare-but-valid uses for `mixed`, we should be as specific as possible with choosing an appropriate type for some purpose. As
such, the use of `mixed` is discouraged unless there is no other type-safe alternative.
